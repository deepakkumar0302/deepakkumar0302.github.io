    <h3><strong>Graduate Teaching Scholar (GTS) – Virginia Tech</strong></h3>
    <p>
      As a <strong>Graduate Teaching Scholar</strong> in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), 
      I participated in advanced pedagogical training and teaching workshops focused on student engagement, 
      inclusive teaching, and active learning.

    <h3><strong>Teaching and Learning Scholarship</strong></h3>
<p>
  I am conducting a classroom-based randomized controlled trial titled 
  <em>“Investigating the Retrieval Effect with and without AI Support: A Randomized Controlled Trial among College Students,”</em> 
  in collaboration with Professor George Davis. The experiment evaluates how retrieval practice, through a pre-exam practice test, 
  affects learning outcomes when paired with or without AI assistance. Students are randomly assigned to one of three groups: 
  a retrieval practice with AI support group, a retrieval practice without AI group, 
  and a pure control group that receives a placebo activity instead of testing. All students later take the same 
  post-practice exam under identical conditions. By comparing their performance, the study assesses whether AI-assisted retrieval 
  enhances, substitutes, or undermines the cognitive benefits of traditional testing. The results contribute to the scholarship 
  of teaching and learning by providing rigorous evidence on how AI tools influence knowledge retention and cognitive effort 
  in higher education.
