    <h1>Teaching Experience</h1>

    <p>
      I am passionate about teaching and mentoring students in development and applied economics.
      My teaching integrates empirical applications, classroom engagement, and real-world examples 
      to help students connect economic concepts to development policy.

    <h2>Graduate Teaching Scholar (GTS) – Virginia Tech</h2>
    <p>
      As a <strong>Graduate Teaching Scholar</strong> in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), 
      I participated in advanced pedagogical training and teaching workshops focused on student engagement, 
      inclusive teaching, and active learning. I implemented these methods in my courses by incorporating 
      randomized in-class experiments, live quizzes, and applied problem-solving sessions.
