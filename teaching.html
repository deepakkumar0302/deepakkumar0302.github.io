    <h1>Teaching</h1>
    <p>
      I care deeply about helping students connect economic theory to real-world development challenges.
      My teaching emphasizes active learning, empirical applications, and clear intuition.

        Undergraduate course on the economics of global agricultural development, poverty, and trade.
