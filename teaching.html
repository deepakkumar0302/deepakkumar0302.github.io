    <h2>Graduate Teaching Scholar (GTS) – Virginia Tech</h2>
    <p>
      As a <strong>Graduate Teaching Scholar</strong> in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), 
      I participated in advanced pedagogical training and teaching workshops focused on student engagement, 
      inclusive teaching, and active learning. 
    </p>

    <h2>Teaching and Learning Scholarship</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently conducting a teaching and learning research project titled 
      <em>“Investigating the Retrieval Effect with and without AI Support: A Randomized Controlled Trial among College Students”</em>, 
      with <strong>Professor George Davis</strong>. This study evaluates how retrieval practice — with and without AI assistance — 
      influences student learning outcomes and retention in economics courses. The project contributes to the growing evidence 
      on effective teaching strategies in higher education.
