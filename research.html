      <h4><strong>Weaker Typhoons and Economic Impact: Evidence from Vietnam</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">Job market paper</div>
       <div class="subtitle">with Chi Ta</div>
      <p>
     This paper quantifies the short-run economic impacts of low-intensity typhoons on
local economic activity. We construct a commune-by-month panel data of energy con-
sumption and merge it with detailed typhoon-track data across three coastal provinces
in Vietnam from 2012 to 2022. By exploiting fine spatial variation in typhoon ex-
posure, we estimate dynamic responses of energy consumption using an event-study
difference-in-differences design and a stacked difference-in-differences estimator. Our
results indicate that communes within 15 kilometers of a tropical storm experience an
immediate decline of about 30 percent energy consumption in the month of the land-
fall, with waning effects persisting for up to six months. The losses are highly localized,
concentrated in rural and coastal communes, and larger for non-household customers
outside of urban areas. Furthermore, we estimate that a typical tropical storm in our
study region reduces annual provincial GDP by roughly 0.2 to 0.3 percent, correspond-
ing to about USD 45 to 65 million in 2022 terms. However, night-time lights data from
remote-sensing based measures, a commonly used proxy for local economic activity,
fails to detect the disruptions caused by low-intensity typhoons. While remotely sensed
data may fairly estimate losses of high-intensity storms, they likely miss a meaningful
share of the economic costs imposed by lower intensity, albeit frequent, events.

      <h4><strong>A Gendered Approach to Economic Impacts of Refugee Aid in Kenya</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">with Anubhab Gupta, Justin Kagin, and J. Edward Taylor</div>
      <p>
       This paper evaluates the local economy impacts of hosting refugees using a structural general 
        equilibrium model of refugees and host populations around a refugee camp in Kenya. The model 
        is calibrated with primary micro-household data on refugee households and secondary data on 
        host-country households to examine impacts through a gender lens. We distinguish between 
        female- and male-headed refugee households and trace how refugee assistance, both cash and 
        in-kind, affects total inflation-adjusted incomes, local production, and employment for refugees 
        and hosts. Our simulations quantify the direct and indirect effects of refugee aid on the
        surrounding economy and estimate the resulting income multipliers. We find slightly larger local 
        economy impacts of transfers directed to female-headed households. We also show that cash 
        assistance generates higher income multipliers than in-kind aid, in line with previous evidence. 
        The study complements evidence based on nighttime lights, which can provide causal identification 
        that is not possible with general equilibrium modelling, while this paper is the first to estimate 
        the impact of refugees on host populations through a gendered lens using a structural general 
        equilibrium model, which is not possible with nighttime lights data.

      <h4><strong>Strangers to Neighbors: Does Refugee Host Integration Improve Local Economic Development</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">with Anubhab Gupta</div>
      <p>
      Refugee settlements can either isolate displaced populations from host communities or foster local
      integration. This paper examines whether refugee–host integration promotes local economic
      development, using evidence from Kenya’s transition from traditional camps to integrated settlements.
      The study exploits the establishment of the Kalobeyei Integrated Settlement in 2016,
      designed to promote refugee self-reliance and closer interaction with host communities, as a natural
      experiment. Using most advanced nighttime lights (NTL) data and an event-study difference-indifferences
      framework, we estimate the temporal and spatial effects of Kalobeyei’s opening on
      surrounding economic activity. Results show that integrated settlements generate stronger and
      more sustained growth in local economic activity than traditional camps. We further combine
      household survey data with a CGE model to estimate how each dollar of aid received translates
      into gains for the host economy. The results indicate that integrated refugee settlements yield larger
      economic multipliers compared to traditional camps. Overall, the paper contributes to the growing
      literature on the economic impacts of refugee integration and the design of inclusive settlement
      policies.

      <h4><strong>Adoption of Agricultural Technologies by Smallholder Farmers: A Synthesis of Empirical Evidence</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">with Miki Khanh Doan</div>
      <p>
       This paper synthesizes recent empirical evidence on the adoption of agricultural technologies by smallholder
        farmers in low and middle income countries. It brings together findings from randomized evaluations and 
        large scale programs in Africa and Asia to explain why promising tools for higher productivity and climate
        smart agriculture remain underused. The review documents intertwined constraints related to liquidity, 
        risk, information, market access, and local institutions, and shows how these constraints are often more
        severe for poorer, more remote, and female farmers. It argues that climate smart practices can raise 
        yields, income, and resilience to climate shocks, but that their returns are uncertain, context specific,
        and often realized only over long horizons, which discourages take up. The paper concludes that isolated 
        interventions such as stand alone credit, subsidies, or extension are usually insufficient, and that 
        bundled approaches which combine financial services, risk management, tailored advice, and stronger links
        to output markets offer more promise for inclusive and climate resilient rural transformation.

      <h4><strong>Covariate Shocks, Women’s Bargaining Power, and Household Vulnerability</strong></h4>
       <div class="subtitle">with Vivek Pandey, Hari Krishnan Nagarajan, and Harpreet Singh </div>
      <p>
      Can increased women’s relative bargaining power within households improve household-level resilience 
        to large scale covariate shocks? Evidence from a recent pandemic suggests that enabling women to access 
        market-linked-value-chains significantly increases their relative bargaining power within households. 
        In this paper we estimate the extent to which a given stock of market-enabled-relative bargaining power 
        of women influenced the resilience of rural households to the covariate shock. We utilize a unique 
        data-generating process that combines data from two rounds of household surveys with the data from a 
        laboratory experiment that was conducted with both the spouses in rural dairy households. Evidence 
        from the shift-share instrumental variable approach shows that a unit improvement in women’s bargaining 
        power led to a 3.82 per cent reduction in the vulnerability of households to food poverty during the 
        pandemic. The paper also models the role of food and nutrition decisions as pathways to reducing household
        vulnerability to food poverty during the shock.

      <h4><strong>COVID-19, information management by local governments, and food consumption</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">with Vivek Pandey and Shyam Singh </div>
      <div class="subtitle">Journal: Food Policy </div>
      <p>
        Federal and state governments in developing countries have tasked local governments with managing COVID-19 on the ground. 
        The bottom-up approach is critical to ensuring household food security, especially in rural areas. We have utilized data 
        from a panel of Indian households that participated in two rounds of a livelihoods survey. While the first round was fielded 
        before COVID-19, the second round was conducted telephonically after the COVID-19-lockdown. We developed an Information 
        Management Response Index (IMRI) to measure the strength of local governments’ information management initiatives. 
        The difference-in-difference estimates show that local governments could partially mitigate the pandemic’s adverse effects on 
        (a) level and distribution (adult-equivalent per-capita) of food and nutrition expenditure and (b) household vulnerability to 
        food and nutrition poverty. For landless households, IMRI led to statistically significant and additional welfare effects. 
        Three channels explain our empirical findings: (a) maintenance of essential commodities through fair-price shops, (b) access 
        to paid employment and cash (income effect), and (c) disease management (substitution effect). The estimates have been adjusted 
        for sample attrition and multiple-hypothesis correction. We conducted robustness checks with respect to index construction, 
        instrumental variable estimation, and sub-group analysis.

      <h4><strong>Impact of Gendered Participation in market-linked value-chains on Economic Outcomes: Evidence from India</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">with Vivek Pandey and Hari Krishnan Nagarajan </div>
      <div class="subtitle">Journal: Food Policy </div>
      <p>
        We combine the results of a laboratory experiment and survey of agricultural households to estimate the welfareimpacts 
        of a market-based intervention with links to value-chain. We investigate whether increased participationby women 
        in such value-chains improves their relative bargaining power and therefore their ability to contributeto household
        welfare. We utilize the National Dairy Plan-I as an example to estimate pathways through whichsuch interventions may 
        affect household decision-making. We find that the program design significantlyincreased women’s relative bargaining 
        power within the household, which acts as an important channel forenhancing women’s ability to contribute to household 
        welfare through decision-making processes related tofood, nutrition, branded food items, and child education. The 
        instrumental variable estimates show that if value-chains are gender-neutral then direct program effects are significant 
        but small. Participation in National DairyPlan-I, on the other hand, improved women’s relative bargaining power, allowing 
        them to make substantialcontribution to welfare. We show that when women’s bargaining power mediates participation in 
        value-chains,the nutrition elasticity rises from 0.26 to 0.94. While the impact on analytical ability (i.e., mathematics 
        Z-score)is negligible in the absence of female agency, performance improves by 0.35σ when gendered element(s) of theprogram 
        are allowed to act as a channel.

      <div class="subtitle">with Vivek Pandey and Ankita Rathi </div>
      <div class="subtitle">Journal: Public Administration and Development </div>
      <p>
    A great deal of work argues that the entry of women into public spaces can promote political and institutional change. The COVID‐19 provides
        an opportunity to investigate whether and under what conditions women's political representation in rural local governments deliver 
        effective local governance? Drawing from two rounds of data collected in 174 local governments and 1051 households in three Indian states, 
        the paper shows that women Pradhans in the Gram Panchayats had no differential impact on the governance response to COVID‐19 compared to 
        the unreserved ones. Analyzing the heterogeneity in these responses suggests that institutional factors like the proportion of women in 
        village council and local entrepreneurship diversity can enhance women Pradhan's capacity to respond to the pandemic. We explore two 
        channels that enable women Pradhan to govern effectively during the pandemic: improving women's participation in the labor force and 
        reducing household's vulnerability to poverty in the pre‐COVID period.

      <div class="subtitle">Journal:  Annals of Operations Research </div>
      <p>
      Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCSs) maintain the availability and supply of clean processed milk in accordance with consumer needs, 
        as well as the provision of essential milk products of the appropriate standard to consumers at competitive prices. In this study, 
        numerous aspects responsible for the success of India’s Dairy Cooperative Society (DCS) have been taken into account before developing 
        a composite index. The criteria addressed include milk union support, DCS support, governance and management support, allied support,
        and common support factors for DCS performance evaluation. The current study is projected to empower the dairy industry by offering a
        tool that can evaluate the relative success of DCSs and assist milk unions and dairy organizations in tailoring their assistance to their 
        specific requirements. We deployed the Analytical Hierarchal Process (AHP) to determine the weights of specified criteria and sub-criteria 
        impacting DCS performance; these weights were deployed to determine the relative performance of a DCS using the composite index developed 
        in the study. Criteria such as governance and management support given to members, and support received from milk unions have significant 
        weightage- 0.3002, 0.2854, and 0.2715, respectively. We also deployed the suggested technique to conduct a comparative analysis of 98 DCSs 
        identified from six Indian provinces constituted under NDP I (National Dairy Plan, Phase-I). Finally, the results of the sensitivity analysis
        have been presented to validate our proposed method.
