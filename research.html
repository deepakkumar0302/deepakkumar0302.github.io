      <h4><strong>Weaker Typhoons and Economic Impact: Evidence from Vietnam</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">Job market paper</div>
      <p>
        This paper quantifies the short-run economic impacts of low-intensity typhoons,
defined as tropical storms and tropical depressions, on local economic activity. We 
construct a commune-by-month panel from monthly energy
consumption records for residential and non-residential customers for a period of 2012-2022 across three coastal
provinces in Vietnam and merging these data with detailed typhoon track information.
We exploit fine spatial variation in exposure, defined by proximity within 15 kilometers
of a storm’s path, and estimate dynamic responses using an event-study difference-in-
differences design and a stacked difference-in-differences estimator. Communes within
15 kilometers of a tropical storm experience an immediate decline of about 30 percent in
energy consumption in the month of landfall, with effects that persist for several months
and largely dissipate by month six, while tropical depressions have no detectable effect.
The losses are highly localized, concentrated in rural and coastal communes, and larger
for non-household customers outside urban areas. Using an estimated elasticity that
links a 10 percent decline in energy consumption to a 2.3 percent decline in provin-
cial GDP, we estimate that a typical tropical storm in the study region reduces total
provincial GDP by roughly 0.2 to 0.3 percent, corresponding to about 45 to 65 million
USD in 2022 terms. Finally, we show that night-time lights, a commonly used proxy
for local economic activity, fails to detect these disruptions. These findings indicate
that standard disaster statistics and remote-sensing based measures miss a meaningful
share of the economic costs imposed by lower-intensity but frequent events.

      <div class="subtitle">with coauthors · Work in progress</div>
      <p>
        This project studies how large-scale refugee settlements and humanitarian aid reshape
        host economies in northern Kenya. Using nighttime lights, household data, and a local
        general equilibrium model, we quantify how transfers to refugees spill over to
        male- and female-headed households in surrounding communities and how camp design
        (traditional vs. integrated settlements) affects these outcomes.

      <div class="subtitle">with Vivek Pandey & Hari Krishnan Nagarajan </div>
      <div class="subtitle">Journal: Food Policy </div>
      <p>
    A great deal of work argues that the entry of women into public spaces can promote political and institutional change. The COVID‐19 provides
        an opportunity to investigate whether and under what conditions women's political representation in rural local governments deliver 
        effective local governance? Drawing from two rounds of data collected in 174 local governments and 1051 households in three Indian states, 
        the paper shows that women Pradhans in the Gram Panchayats had no differential impact on the governance response to COVID‐19 compared to 
        the unreserved ones. Analyzing the heterogeneity in these responses suggests that institutional factors like the proportion of women in 
        village council and local entrepreneurship diversity can enhance women Pradhan's capacity to respond to the pandemic. We explore two 
        channels that enable women Pradhan to govern effectively during the pandemic: improving women's participation in the labor force and 
        reducing household's vulnerability to poverty in the pre‐COVID period.

      <h4><strong>Performance assessment of Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCSs): an AHP based composite index approach</strong></h4>

      <p>
      Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCSs) maintain the availability and supply of clean processed milk in accordance with consumer needs, 
        as well as the provision of essential milk products of the appropriate standard to consumers at competitive prices. In this study, 
        numerous aspects responsible for the success of India’s Dairy Cooperative Society (DCS) have been taken into account before developing 
        a composite index. The criteria addressed include milk union support, DCS support, governance and management support, allied support,
        and common support factors for DCS performance evaluation. The current study is projected to empower the dairy industry by offering a
        tool that can evaluate the relative success of DCSs and assist milk unions and dairy organizations in tailoring their assistance to their 
        specific requirements. We deployed the Analytical Hierarchal Process (AHP) to determine the weights of specified criteria and sub-criteria 
        impacting DCS performance; these weights were deployed to determine the relative performance of a DCS using the composite index developed 
        in the study. Criteria such as governance and management support given to members, and support received from milk unions have significant 
        weightage- 0.3002, 0.2854, and 0.2715, respectively. We also deployed the suggested technique to conduct a comparative analysis of 98 DCSs 
        identified from six Indian provinces constituted under NDP I (National Dairy Plan, Phase-I). Finally, the results of the sensitivity analysis
        have been presented to validate our proposed method.

      <h4><strong>COVID-19, information management by local governments, and food consumption</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">with Vivek Pandey & Shyam Singh </div>

      <p>
        Federal and state governments in developing countries have tasked local governments with managing COVID-19 on the ground. 
        The bottom-up approach is critical to ensuring household food security, especially in rural areas. We have utilized data 
        from a panel of Indian households that participated in two rounds of a livelihoods survey. While the first round was fielded 
        before COVID-19, the second round was conducted telephonically after the COVID-19-lockdown. We developed an Information 
        Management Response Index (IMRI) to measure the strength of local governments’ information management initiatives. 
        The difference-in-difference estimates show that local governments could partially mitigate the pandemic’s adverse effects on 
        (a) level and distribution (adult-equivalent per-capita) of food and nutrition expenditure and (b) household vulnerability to 
        food and nutrition poverty. For landless households, IMRI led to statistically significant and additional welfare effects. 
        Three channels explain our empirical findings: (a) maintenance of essential commodities through fair-price shops, (b) access 
        to paid employment and cash (income effect), and (c) disease management (substitution effect). The estimates have been adjusted 
        for sample attrition and multiple-hypothesis correction. We conducted robustness checks with respect to index construction, 
        instrumental variable estimation, and sub-group analysis.

      <h4><strong>Impact of Gendered Participation in market-linked value-chains on Economic Outcomes: Evidence from India</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">with Vivek Pandey & Hari Krishnan Nagarajan </div>
      <div class="subtitle">Journal: Food Policy </div>
      <p>
        We combine the results of a laboratory experiment and survey of agricultural households to estimate the welfareimpacts 
        of a market-based intervention with links to value-chain. We investigate whether increased participationby women 
        in such value-chains improves their relative bargaining power and therefore their ability to contributeto household
        welfare. We utilize the National Dairy Plan-I as an example to estimate pathways through whichsuch interventions may 
        affect household decision-making. We find that the program design significantlyincreased women’s relative bargaining 
        power within the household, which acts as an important channel forenhancing women’s ability to contribute to household 
        welfare through decision-making processes related tofood, nutrition, branded food items, and child education. The 
        instrumental variable estimates show that if value-chains are gender-neutral then direct program effects are significant 
        but small. Participation in National DairyPlan-I, on the other hand, improved women’s relative bargaining power, allowing 
        them to make substantialcontribution to welfare. We show that when women’s bargaining power mediates participation in 
        value-chains,the nutrition elasticity rises from 0.26 to 0.94. While the impact on analytical ability (i.e., mathematics 
        Z-score)is negligible in the absence of female agency, performance improves by 0.35σ when gendered element(s) of theprogram 
        are allowed to act as a channel.
