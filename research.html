      <h4><strong>Weaker Typhoons and Economic Impact: Evidence from Vietnam</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">Job market paper</div>
      <p>
        This paper quantifies the short-run economic impacts of low-intensity typhoons,
defined as tropical storms and tropical depressions, on local economic activity. We con-
struct a commune-by-month panel from 2012 to 2022 by aggregating monthly energy
consumption records for residential and non-residential customers across three coastal
provinces in Vietnam and merging these data with detailed typhoon track information.
We exploit fine spatial variation in exposure, defined by proximity within 15 kilometers
of a storm’s path, and estimate dynamic responses using an event-study difference-in-
differences design and a stacked difference-in-differences estimator. Communes within
15 kilometers of a tropical storm experience an immediate decline of about 30 percent in
energy consumption in the month of landfall, with effects that persist for several months
and largely dissipate by month six, while tropical depressions have no detectable effect.
The losses are highly localized, concentrated in rural and coastal communes, and larger
for non-household customers outside urban areas. Using an estimated elasticity that
links a 10 percent decline in energy consumption to a 2.3 percent decline in provin-
cial GDP, we estimate that a typical tropical storm in the study region reduces total
provincial GDP by roughly 0.2 to 0.3 percent, corresponding to about 45 to 65 million
USD in 2022 terms. Finally, we show that night-time lights, a commonly used proxy
for local economic activity, fails to detect these disruptions. These findings indicate
that standard disaster statistics and remote-sensing based measures miss a meaningful
share of the economic costs imposed by lower-intensity but frequent events.

      <h4><strong>A Gendered Approach to Economic Impacts of Refugee Aid in Kenya</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">with coauthors · Work in progress</div>
      <p>
        This project studies how large-scale refugee settlements and humanitarian aid reshape
        host economies in northern Kenya. Using nighttime lights, household data, and a local
        general equilibrium model, we quantify how transfers to refugees spill over to
        male- and female-headed households in surrounding communities and how camp design
        (traditional vs. integrated settlements) affects these outcomes.

      <h4><strong>Climate-Smart Agriculture and Technology Adoption</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">Ongoing work · Literature synthesis and empirical applications</div>
      <p>
        I review and extend evidence on the adoption of climate-smart agricultural technologies
        by smallholder farmers, emphasizing constraints faced by poor and vulnerable households
        and the role of bundled interventions that combine information, finance, and risk
        management tools.
