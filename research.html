      My research focuses on climate adaptation, refugee-host interactions, and the local
      economic impacts of development interventions.

      <h4><strong>Weaker Typhoons and Economic Impact: Evidence from Vietnam</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">Job market paper</div>
      <p>
        This paper uses monthly household electricity consumption and satellite nightlights from
        three coastal provinces in north-central Vietnam (2012–2022) to estimate the short-run
        impacts of low-intensity typhoons on local economic activity. I combine event-study and
        stacked difference-in-differences designs with high-resolution wind exposure measures
        to quantify how storms affect energy use across space and over time.

      <h4><strong>A Gendered Approach to Economic Impacts of Refugee Aid in Kenya</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">with coauthors · Work in progress</div>
      <p>
        This project studies how large-scale refugee settlements and humanitarian aid reshape
        host economies in northern Kenya. Using nighttime lights, household data, and a local
        general equilibrium model, we quantify how transfers to refugees spill over to
        male- and female-headed households in surrounding communities and how camp design
        (traditional vs. integrated settlements) affects these outcomes.

      <h4><strong>Climate-Smart Agriculture and Technology Adoption</strong></h4>
      <div class="subtitle">Ongoing work · Literature synthesis and empirical applications</div>
      <p>
        I review and extend evidence on the adoption of climate-smart agricultural technologies
        by smallholder farmers, emphasizing constraints faced by poor and vulnerable households
        and the role of bundled interventions that combine information, finance, and risk
        management tools.
