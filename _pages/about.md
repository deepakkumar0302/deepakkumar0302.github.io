Greetings! I am thrilled to welcome you to my personal website. I am currently pursuing my PhD in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://aaec.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech, USA](https://www.vt.edu/). My research interest lies at the intersection of international development, agriculture, and food economics. 

I earned my Master's degree in Economics from [Jawaharlal Nehru University, India](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/), and completed my Bachelor's in Statistics at [Hindu College, University of Delhi, India](https://hinducollege.ac.in/). 

Before joining Virginia Tech, I was a Research Fellow at the [Verghese Kurien Policy Lab (VKPL)](https://www.irma.ac.in/centres-of-excellence-units/verghese-kurien-policy-lab-vkpl) at the [Institute of Rural Management Anand, India](https://irma.ac.in/). My work at VKPL involved exploring the effects of development interventions on welfare outcomes. I have worked on a range of development topics, and my published works can be found [here](publications).
